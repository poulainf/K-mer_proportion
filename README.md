Synthetic genome building
For each genome a corresponding “synthetic coding genome” was generated by concatenation of the genes coding sequences using a custom PERL software ***** deposited in open access at XXX... (Figure 1)
K-mer ratio determination
We estimated K-mers representation in synthetic genome by calculating the ratio of observed vs. expected K-mers number of count as described by Werman et al. (29). A K-mer is defined as a collection of sequences with a commune motif. For instance the NTC K-mer encompasses ATC, CTC, GTC and TTC sequences. The number of observed K-mers is directly count from synthetic genome.  Expected number is estimated by the average of one thousand K-mers counting of randomly shuffled sequences. This null model based on one thousand iteration ensure a random K-mer occurrence representation of sequences with a same nucleotide composition. All these analyzes was performed by developed custom PERL software which is accessible in open access at XXX.
The genic analysis of K-mer representation was achieved by the same approach processed on non-concatenated genes coding sequences.
The returned observed vs. expected K-mer ratio indicate the representation of the K-mer in the analyze sequence. A ratio value << 0 indicate a K-mer under representation and a value = 0 point a non-affected representation.
