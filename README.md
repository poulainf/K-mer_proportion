# K-MER Analysis #
K-mer_proportion is a PERL software suite that enables analysis of K-mer representativity in coding sequence datasets.

We estimate K-mer representation in synthetic genomes by calculating the ratio of observed versus expected K-mer counts, following the approach described by Werman et al. (https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/vev015). A K-mer is defined as a set of sequences sharing a common motif. For instance, the NTC K-mer includes the sequences ATC, CTC, GTC, and TTC. The observed count of K-mers is directly calculated from the synthetic genome, while the expected count is estimated by averaging K-mer counts across one thousand random shuffles of the sequences. This null model, based on one thousand iterations, provides a baseline representation of random K-mer occurrence in sequences with the same nucleotide composition.

The resulting observed-to-expected K-mer ratio indicates the representation of each K-mer in the analyzed sequence. A ratio < 0 suggests underrepresentation of the K-mer, while a ratio around 0 indicates no significant deviation from expected representation. 


## GENOMIC K-MER analysis ##
###  Synthetic coding genome
cds_ncds_split.pl

For each genome, a "synthetic coding genome" is generated by concatenating coding sequences.

###  Input sequence split to reduce counter analysis 
cds_ncds_split.02.pl

The synthetic coding genome FASTA file is split to facilitate parallel processing.

###  K-mer ratio determination
Trikmer_analyser_0.5_global1000.pl

This script analyzes the preformatted files to determine K-mer ratios.
